## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Git

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pronzzz/pranav-clicks.git
    cd pranav-clicks
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 📸 Workflow: Adding Photos

We've automated the gallery management. You don't need to touch the code to add photos!

### Method 1: The "Bot" (Automatic)

1.  **Drop your photos** into the `public/gallery` folder.
    *   *Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP.*
    *   *Tip: Name your files nicely (e.g., `urban-sunset.jpg` becomes "Urban Sunset").*
2.  Run the sync script:
    ```bash
    npm run gallery:sync
    ```
3.  **That's it!** The website code is automatically updated with your new images.

### Method 2: Watch Mode (Real-time)

If you are adding many photos, you can keep the watcher running:

```bash
npm run gallery:watch
```

This acts as a local "bot" that watches the folder. As soon as you save a file to `public/gallery`, it updates the app instantly.

### Method 3: Manual Git Push

When you are ready to go live:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "New photos"
git push
```

(Note: If you have configured the auto-push script, this might happen automatically!)
